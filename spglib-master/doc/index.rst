Spglib
======

Spglib is a library for finding and handling crystal symmetries
written in C. There are the :ref:`python <python_spglib>`,
:ref:`fortran, and ruby <interfaces>` interfaces.
Version history is found at `ChangeLog
<https://github.com/atztogo/spglib/blob/master/ChangeLog>`_.

The detailed algorithm of spglib is describted the following text:

* ":math:`\texttt{Spglib}`: a software library for crystal symmetry search",
  Atsushi Togo and Isao Tanaka,
  https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01590 (written at version 1.10.4)

   -----

   * SpglibDataset is slightly modified at version 1.9.4. This may hit
     some users.

   * Python module pyspglib is renamed to spglib in version 1.9.0.

     In versions 1.8.x or before, the python wrapper (pyspglib) was
     considered as a special extention of spglib and separately maintained,
     but in version 1.9.x and later, it starts to be a part of spglib as a
     usual extension, and this python wrapper will be maintained to work
     following every update of c-spglib. The package name is changed from
     pyspglib to spglib. Following this change, the way to import python
     spglib module is changed and it is written in :ref:`python_spglib`.
